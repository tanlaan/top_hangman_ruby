# TOP Hangman: Ruby edition

This is an exercise to create a Ruby CLI program which will do the following:
* Read words from a file, keeping only those of 5-12 characters in length
* Allow a player to guess words while:
  * Displaying a hanged man
  * Displaying the correctly guessed letters of their word
* Allow for state to be saved and continued on a later run
